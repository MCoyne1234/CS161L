Included: 
    my_alu.v 
    my_alu_testbench.v

As far as my testing goes, the functionality is complete and correct, catching overflow and
carryout as required by the operations. 

I did not realize that the template and test bench where hyperlinks, so i rolled my own.
The functional requirements are met, it's all very similar and functionally the same.
